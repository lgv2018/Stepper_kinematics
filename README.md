# Stepper_Function Library (working progress)
[https://tinkersprojects.com/](https://tinkersprojects.com/)

This is a library to calculate the kinematics and inverse kinematics from a given point. The library will calculate positions, join angles, speeds and the control of stepper motors. This is a working progress and may not be working for a while.
